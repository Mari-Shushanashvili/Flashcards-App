     * @method recognizeGesture
     * Analyzes an array of 21 hand landmarks to determine the current gesture
     * based on predefined geometric conditions.
     *
     * @param landmarks An array of 21 hand landmark objects (Keypoints), ordered
     * according to the MediaPipe Hands model standard.
     * Requires at least `x` and `y` coordinates.
     * @returns The recognized `Gesture` enum value. Returns `Gesture.Unknown` if
     * input is invalid or no specific gesture is confidently matched.
     *
     * @specConditions
     * - Requires `landmarks` to be a valid array of at least 21 `Keypoint` objects.
     * - Geometric conditions (using Y-coordinates primarily, assuming standard
     * image coordinates where lower Y is higher on the screen, and assuming
     * the hand is mostly upright. X/Z coordinates might be needed for refinement):
     *
     * 1. ThumbsUp:
     * - Thumb tip (4) Y-coordinate is significantly *less* (higher on screen) than
     * the thumb IP joint (3) Y-coordinate.
     * - Thumb tip (4) Y-coordinate is significantly *less* than the Y-coordinates
     * of the MCP joints of the other four fingers (5, 9, 13, 17).
     * - The fingertips of the other four fingers (8, 12, 16, 20) have Y-coordinates
     * *greater* (lower on screen) than their respective PIP joints (6, 10, 14, 18),
     * indicating they are curled.
     *
     * 2. ThumbsDown:
     * - Thumb tip (4) Y-coordinate is significantly *greater* (lower on screen) than
     * the thumb MCP joint (2) Y-coordinate.
     * - Thumb tip (4) Y-coordinate is significantly *greater* than the Y-coordinate
     * of the wrist (0).
     * - The fingertips of the other four fingers (8, 12, 16, 20) have Y-coordinates
     * *greater* (lower on screen) than their respective PIP joints (6, 10, 14, 18),
     * indicating they are curled.
     *
     * 3. FlatHand:
     * - All five fingertips (4, 8, 12, 16, 20) have Y-coordinates *less* (higher
     * on screen) than their respective base joints (e.g., MCP joints 2, 5, 9, 13, 17),
     * indicating finger extension.
     * - (Optional refinement: Fingertips are roughly horizontally aligned,
     * considering potential hand rotation - might involve comparing Y values
     * within a certain tolerance or using more complex geometry).
     *
     * - If none of the above conditions are met, returns `Gesture.Unknown`.
     * - "Significantly" implies using appropriate thresholds during implementation.
     *
     * TODO(P2-C3-S4): Implement the actual gesture recognition logic based on these conditions.
